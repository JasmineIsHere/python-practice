<h1> BAGELS GAME </h1>

### Original Game: <br>
Bagels is Math guessing game where a user must guess a three-digit number based on clues. After each guess, the computer gives the player three types of clues: <br>
- Bagel (the number is not correct and not in the answer at all)
- Pico (the number is correct but it is in the wrong spot)
- Fermi (the number is correct and it is in the correct location)
<br><br>

### Further Extensions: <strong>[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)</strong> <br>
Instead with numbers, users guess a 5-letter word and after each guess, the game also returns the player with 3 clues in terms of colours: <br>
- Grey (the letter is not correct and not in the answer at all)
- Yellow (the letter is correct but it is in the wrong spot)
- Green (the letter is correct and it is in the correct location)
